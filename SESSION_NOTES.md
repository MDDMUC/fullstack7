## Work Log (last ~8 hours)

### Supabase data model and seeding
- Added gyms with slugs/locations/avatars for Munich: Boulderwelt West/Ost, DAV Freimann, DAV Thalkirchen, Einstein Boulderhalle, Heavens Gate. Ensured `avatar_url` is the sole image field.
- Normalized `threads.gym_id` to `uuid`, added FK to `gyms(id)`, enforced unique `(gym_id, title)`.
- Created standard gym threads per gym (`General`, `Beta Center`, `Routesetting`) and enrolled all users into them (thread_participants).
- Cleaned duplicates: repointed threads to canonical gym IDs, deleted duplicate gyms, removed unused slug-null gyms.
- Validation queries were provided to verify counts, titles, and memberships.

### Chats UI & Supabase wiring
- `/chats/page.tsx`: switched from placeholders to live Supabase threads; subscription refresh on messages; fetches counterpart profiles; handles gym threads; fixed null-supabase cleanup.
- `/chats/[id]/page.tsx`: wired 1:1 (and group) chat to Supabase; fetches thread/messages/participants; realtime subscription; sending messages with statuses.
- Replaced `next/image` with `<img>` for Figma-hosted assets to avoid unconfigured-host errors.

### Gyms cleanup (final state)
- Unique slugs with avatar URLs present; no duplicate gyms; six gyms total; each with 3 gym threads.

### Styles/components
- Implemented multiple tokenized mobile components (filter buttons, dropdowns, mobile navbar), special chips (pro/founder/crew), and landing page updates; globals.css is tokenized via tokens.css.
- Recent CSS tweak requested: `GridProfileCard` needs padding 16px (top/bottom/left/right) and width/height to fit-content (pending application if not already done).

### Outstanding/notes
- If hosting more external images with `next/image`, add hosts to `next.config.js` or keep using `<img>`.
- Gym names/avatars can be surfaced in chat list for `type='gym'` threads if desired.
