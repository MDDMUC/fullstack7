## Work Log (last ~8 hours)

### Supabase data model and seeding
- Added gyms with slugs/locations/avatars for Munich: Boulderwelt West/Ost, DAV Freimann, DAV Thalkirchen, Einstein Boulderhalle, Heavens Gate. Ensured `avatar_url` is the sole image field.
- Normalized `threads.gym_id` to `uuid`, added FK to `gyms(id)`, enforced unique `(gym_id, title)`.
- Created standard gym threads per gym (`General`, `Beta Center`, `Routesetting`) and enrolled all users into them (thread_participants).
- Cleaned duplicates: repointed threads to canonical gym IDs, deleted duplicate gyms, removed unused slug-null gyms.
- Validation queries were provided to verify counts, titles, and memberships.

### Chats UI & Supabase wiring
- `/chats/page.tsx`: switched from placeholders to live Supabase threads; subscription refresh on messages; fetches counterpart profiles; handles gym threads; fixed null-supabase cleanup.
- `/chats/[id]/page.tsx`: wired 1:1 (and group) chat to Supabase; fetches thread/messages/participants; realtime subscription; sending messages with statuses.
- Replaced `next/image` with `<img>` for Figma-hosted assets to avoid unconfigured-host errors.

### Gyms cleanup (final state)
- Unique slugs with avatar URLs present; no duplicate gyms; six gyms total; each with 3 gym threads.

### Styles/components
- Implemented multiple tokenized mobile components (filter buttons, dropdowns, mobile navbar), special chips (pro/founder/crew), and landing page updates; globals.css is tokenized via tokens.css.
- Recent CSS tweak requested: `GridProfileCard` needs padding 16px (top/bottom/left/right) and width/height to fit-content (pending application if not already done).
- Chat preview (overview) aligned to Figma: avatar hover stroke uses primary, small shadow; overflow visible so stroke isn’t clipped; title/subtitle hover color is primary; text gap 2px; body/sm on preview text; unread badge pulses; unread wave overlay added.
- Chat detail (1:1) header matches Figma: 24px back/dots icons, grid header with centered name, Inter 16px medium, token colors.
- Input bar matches Figma: 38px height, bg `var(--color-text-default)`, radius `var(--radius-lg)`, Inter 14px medium `var(--color-text-darker)`, no border/outline; send icon uses `/icons/send.svg`.
- Status indicator for outgoing messages uses Figma assets (double tick).
- Chat overview unread wave + pulsing badge; event/gym/directed threads show proper avatars (events use `events.image_url`).
- Event page now loads Supabase events and event threads; displays event covers from bucket (`events.image_url`), with date/time/slots and links into the event thread; images object-fit cover with gradient hover overlay.

### Outstanding/notes
- If hosting more external images with `next/image`, add hosts to `next.config.js` or keep using `<img>`.
- Gym names/avatars can be surfaced in chat list for `type='gym'` threads if desired.

### Recent fixes (home/profile, onboarding)
- Profile/home cards now pull images from onboarding `photo` (normalized storage paths to public URLs) and stop showing fallbacks or empty `src`.
- /home deck filters out the logged-in user; synthesized profiles from `onboardingprofiles` show up even without a `profiles` row.
- PRO badge logic fixed: shows only when status or chips include pro; removed duplicate header badge on home.
- Gradient strokes aligned (outer wrapper only; inner image no stroke); filled corner gaps on image wrapper.
- CTA buttons on /profile use tokenized components (`button-navlink` cancel, `onb-cta-btn` save) and full-width layout.
- Profile name shows first name/email prefix only; chevron buttons left-align text/right-align chevron.
