## Problem
Empty states reduce activation and retention in low-density launch.

## Goal
Seed content so new users see activity on day one.

## Scope
- 20+ seed user profiles with real photos.
- 6 Munich gym threads with 10+ messages each.
- 3-5 events within 2 weeks.
- 2-3 crews with active conversation.
- Friends-in-gym data present.

## Requirements
- Content is realistic and aligned with Munich launch gyms.

## Definition of Done
- All seeding targets met and verified in app.
