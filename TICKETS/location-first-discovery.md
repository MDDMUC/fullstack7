## Problem
Location is the strongest driver of activation, but discovery is not location-first yet.

## Goal
Implement location-based discovery to reduce onboarding friction and improve relevance.

## Scope
- Auto-location for gym suggestions during onboarding.
- "Near you" section on /events with distances.
- "Climbing nearby" section on /home with coarse distance.

## Dependencies
- TICKET-ANA-002 and TICKET-ANA-003 for tracking.

## Definition of Done
- Location-based sections live and validated.
