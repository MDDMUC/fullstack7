# Demographic Research: Germany Climbing (DAB)

Last updated: 2025-12-22

## Summary (what matters)
- The active indoor climbing audience in Germany skews 20-49 with an average age around 35 (DAV gym survey, 2013). This is the core behavioral cohort for DAB.
- DAV membership data shows the largest young-adult block is 26-40 (22.8% of members in 2023). Under-25 is meaningful (22.6%) but smaller than 26-40.
- Climbing in Germany is large and indoor-first: >1M climbers and >500k boulderers; ~550 public climbing and bouldering facilities (DAV facts, Oct 2023).
- Southern Germany is a strong concentration proxy: Bavaria accounts for 179 of 355 DAV sections (50.4%) and Baden-Wuerttemberg 52 (14.6%) per the DAV section list (secondary source). Munich-based sections are among the largest nationally.

## Target demographic (recommended)
- Primary: 22-35 (indoor bouldering + roped gym users, early-career, social, high app adoption)
- Secondary: 36-44 (still inside the dominant 20-49 gym band, likely consistent gym attendance)

Rationale:
- Gym users are concentrated in 20-49 with average age ~35.
- DAV membership age distribution peaks in 26-40, which overlaps the highest-likelihood cohort for repeated gym visits and social matching.
- Younger than 22 may be below target (safety, app adoption, lower purchasing power); older than mid-40s may be smaller for early product-market fit.

## Onboarding and positioning implications
- Lead with fast partner matching for indoor sessions (after-work and weekend).
- Emphasize local gym density, crews, and events over dating-first copy.
- Keep safety and permission-first framing prominent for trust.

Example headline directions (to test)
- "Find a climbing partner for tonight."
- "Meet gym locals who actually climb."
- "Make crews, not just matches."
- "Your climbing circle, in one place."

## Evidence and data points

### DAV membership age structure (2023)
Source: https://www.alpenverein.de/files/mitgliederentwicklung-2023-pm.pdf
- Total members: 1,520,381
- 0-18: 226,134 (14.9%)
- 19-25: 117,728 (7.7%)
- 26-40: 346,380 (22.8%)
- 41-60: 522,960 (34.4%)
- 61+: 307,179 (20.2%)
- 0-25 combined: 343,862 (22.6%)

### DAV totals and youth share (2024)
Source: https://www.alpenverein.de/verband/ueber-den-dav/der-dav-in-zahlen
- Total members: 1,570,602 (as of 31.12.2024)
- Youth share (<=25): 22.6%
- Sections: 355
- Climbing facilities operated by DAV: 220 (includes bouldering)

### Climbing participation and indoor bias
Source: https://www.alpenverein.de/verband/presse/hintergrundinfos/zahlen-und-fakten-zum-klettersport-in-deutschland
- >1M climbers in Germany; >500k boulderers
- ~550 public climbing and bouldering facilities
- "Nearly all" activity is indoor; outdoor participation is higher among roped climbers than boulderers

### Gym user demographic (DAV survey, 2013)
Source: same DAV facts page (2013 gym survey)
- 77% of gym users are 20-49
- Average age ~35
- Gender split: 66% male / 34% female

### Regional concentration proxy (sections by Bundesland)
Source: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Sektionen_des_Deutschen_Alpenvereins
- Bavaria: 179 of 355 sections (50.4%)
- Baden-Wuerttemberg: 52 of 355 sections (14.6%)
- Note: Wikipedia is a secondary source; it cites DAV data and lists sections with membership counts.

### Large southern sections (density signal)
Source: same Wikipedia list
- Sektion Muenchen: 180,667 members (11.5% of DAV total)
- Sektion Oberland: 180,667 members (11.5% of DAV total)

## Gaps and next research
- Discipline-specific age split (bouldering vs roped climbing) is not available in public DAV sources.
- Updated gym demographic survey beyond 2013 is needed.
- Consider acquiring recent gym membership or ticketing data from Munich-area halls to validate the 22-35 focus.
