-- Complete Storage Setup for Avatars
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor after creating your project

-- Step 1: Create the avatars bucket (if it doesn't exist)
-- Note: You can also create this via the Storage UI in Supabase dashboard
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 2: Storage Policies (run storage_policies.sql or use these)

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow public read access to avatars
CREATE POLICY "Public can view avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Verify the bucket was created
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'avatars';
